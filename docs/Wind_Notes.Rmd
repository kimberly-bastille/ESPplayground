### Request

Calculate winds parallel and perpendicular to shore. 

### Background

Wind data available at [NOAA PSL](https://downloads.psl.noaa.gov/Datasets/NARR/Dailies/monolevel/). It comes in two forms 'U-wind' and 'V-wind'. u-wind is positive for a west to east flow (eastward wind) or perpendicular to the coastline and the V-wind is positive for south to north flow (northward wind) or parallel to the coastline. 

### Action

1) Downloaded test dataset (uwind 2021, vwind 2021) from NOAA PSL.
2) Mask to bluefish polygon
3) Extract max wind for that day
4) Plot X = day of year, y = mean wind direction. 

### Draft Plots

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, "uwind2021.png"))

```

Negative values indicate wind blowing onto coast. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, "vwind2021.png"))

```

Wind blows toward the south in the first part of the year then more mixed in second half of the year.
